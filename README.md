This project is an autonomous sorting system that uses a ResNet18 deep learning model to classify images of Lego bricks and sort them based on various physical attributes. Unlike standard sorters, this system features a real-time image classification convoloutional neural network (CNN), allowing the user to swap sorting logic (Color, Stud Count, Length, or Shape) dynamically via software presets.
